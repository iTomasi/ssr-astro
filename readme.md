**How to run this project on local?**

You need clone this project with:

```git
git clone https://github.com/iTomasi/ssr-astro-hackathon.git
```

then, go to "ssr-astr-hackathon" folder and write in the terminal

```git
npm install
```

Before to run the project you need a PostgreSQL database and cloudinary account for some environment variables.

```env
# .env file on root folder

POSTGRES_HOST = 
POSTGRES_PORT = 
POSTGRES_USERNAME = 
POSTGRES_PASSWORD = 
POSTGRES_DB_NAME = 

PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = 
PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET = 
```

once the environment variables are filled, you can run it

any questions you can contact me by discord (Tomas#7018), I will be happy to help you <3
